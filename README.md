# Modbus

This is a slightly modified version of Controllino's** implementation to support devices with RS485 bus, fitting my own needs. 

Please find examples of this library here:

- [RS485TemperatureSensor](https://github.com/maroprjs/RS485TemperatureSensor)

- [RS485WindSensor](https://github.com/maroprjs/RS485WindSensor)

- [Posterboard](https://github.com/maroprjs/Posterboard) (using above sensors)

Controllino is equipped with RS485:

Arduino Mega needs additional MAX485 module:
